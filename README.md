# Comparing Models

### Does complicating the model lead to better results?

**Thesis**

Why complicate something if it doesnt give you any added benefit. We are going to look into the use cases for models and see if complex models yield better results.

**Whats the outcome?** <br />
-We came to find if time and money are not a factor then with the right tuning a CNN model would preform well. Most of the time those variables are limited so making a simple deep learning provides almost as much insight with out the blood, sweat, and tears required to built and prep a CNN. We will continue to learn about this process and learn from our mistakes to evolve our pipeline so that it not so cumbersome.
